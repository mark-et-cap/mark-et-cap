## Welcome
We're @mark-et-cap - We're creating a browser extension that allows traders of stock and crypto to navigate directly from a ticker they've encountered on sites like Reddit, Twitter, Discord, Stocktwits, etc, directly to their preferred online stock brokerage, cryptocurrency exchange or research site. 

Some GIF examples:

## Where we're going

We'd love to gather feedback and build for real-life use cases. Let us know what you'd like to see, what you'd improve on and what's not working. We'd love to intergate with a financial API to give near-realtime price quotes within the browser pop-up menu (to start)!
